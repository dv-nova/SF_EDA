# Project 6. Hotel rating prediction.


### Project description    
EDA for the model for hotel rating prediction.


### Case to solve    
Perform EDA to increase MAPE of the suggested model.



### Short summary of data
The dataset stores information on a range of features, including:
hotel_address - the address of the hotel
review_date - the date when the reviewer posted the relevant review.
average_score - the average score of the hotel, calculated based on the last comment for the last year
hotel_name - the name of the hotel
reviewer_nationality - nationality of the reviewer
negative_review - negative review that the reviewer gave to the hotel.
review_total_negative_word_counts - the total number of words in a negative review
positive_review - positive review given by the reviewer to the hotel
review_total_positive_word_counts - the total number of words in a positive review
reviewer_score - the rating that the reviewer gave the hotel based on his experience
total_number_of_reviews_reviewer_has_given - the number of reviews that reviewers have given in the past
total_number_of_reviews - the total number of valid reviews about the hotel
tags are the tags that the reviewer gave to the hotel.
days_since_review - the duration between the verification date and the cleaning date
additional_number_of_scoring - there are also some guests who just rated the service rather than leaving a review. This number indicates how many valid estimates there are without verification.
lat - latitude of the hotel
lng - the longitude of the hotel

### Project stages  
Creating the baseline model.
Feature creation, selection, standartisation.
Cleaning the dataset.
Model construction.

### Results:  

Additional features were created, EDA was performed.
